# Meeting api

API for the meeting service from Dogood

## Build locally

```bash
# Get the source
git clone git@github.com:TheExpendablesKTH/meeting-api.git
cd meeting-api

# Build and run the application
./gradlew build
./gradlew run

# The application should now be available on port 8080
$ curl http://localhost:8080 | jq
{
  "message": "I am the api!"
}
```

## Availible requests

See the [docs folder](docs/requests-postman-collection.json) for a postman collection of all available requests.

Or run them in the console, eg:

```bash
# Create Call
$ curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8080/calls" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' | jq
{
  "call": {
    "for_user": 2,
    "connection_details": {
      "...": "..."
    },
    "id": 1
  },
  "message": "call was created"
}
```

> these examples use `jq` for readability
